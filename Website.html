            <p class="Def">We took part in several school activities, including the 3D Printing Seminar, where we printed 3D cat models. We also
            created a magazine about Philippine historical sites, participated in the Freshies Salubong welcoming event, and
            attended the AgentBlazer Champion Workshop. These activities helped us learn new skills, explore history, and get
            involved in campus life.</p>

                        We printed pre-designed 3D cat models 
                        during the 3D Printing Seminar. 
                        These prints helped us understand how the 
                        machines work and how designs are brought to life.
