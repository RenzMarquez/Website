            We took part in several school activities, including the 3D Printing Seminar, where we printed 3D cat
            models.
            We also created a magazine about Philippine historical sites, participated in the Freshies Salubong
            welcoming event,
            and attended the AgentBlazer Champion Workshop. These activities helped us learn new skills, explore
            history,
            and get involved in campus life.
